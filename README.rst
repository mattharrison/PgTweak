PgTweak
=======

A tool to run queries against different postgres settings.
Normally one would scour the postgres logs for slow queries.

Scouring logs for queries
-------------------------

Run the following to pull queries from log files::

  pgtweak  --extract-queries --log-file some/pg/log/file > extracted.sql

Getting a query file
--------------------

One can go through extracted.sql to find a query to example, or hand
write them in a text file.

Generating a sample config file
-------------------------------

A config file is used to indicate what settings to tweak.  It is a
json file that looks like this::

  [
    [
      "work_mem", 
      [
        "1MB", 
        "512MB"
      ]
    ], 
    [
      "maintenance_work_mem", 
      [
        "1MB", 
        "512MB"
      ]
    ]
  ]

That is the one generated by::

  pgtweak --gen-config

You can add more settings and possible values for settings.  Remember
though, that it will test the combination of each setting.  For every
new value option you add to a setting, you double the runs.  (Note
that just adding an setting with a single value just includes that in
every run.)

Testing settings
----------------

Run::

  pgtweak --query-file simple.sql --analyze-queries --dburl postgres://postgres@localhost/testetl --config-file conf.json > results.json

Note that ``dburl`` is a SqlAlchemy style connection string like
``postgres://user:password@host:post/database``

The ``results.json`` file contains JSON list containing the query, time to
run, results, and settings for that query.

Enabling Logging
================

Need to turn on Postgres logging in ``postgresql.conf``::

  log_destination = stderr
  logging_collector = on
  log_filename = 'pgsql-%Y-%m-%d.log'
  log_min_error_statement = 'error'
  log_connections = false
  log_line_prefix = '<%t>'
  log_statement = all
  log_directory = '/var/log/pglog'

* Make sure log_directory exists and has correct permissions

* Restart postgres
